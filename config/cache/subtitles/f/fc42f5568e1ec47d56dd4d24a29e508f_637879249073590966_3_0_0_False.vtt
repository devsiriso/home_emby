00:01.368 --> 00:03.301
<i>Are you ready for</i>
<i>the new season of</i>  Family Guy?

00:03.336 --> 00:05.570
(gasps)
Can you give me a moment?

00:05.605 --> 00:09.341
<i>See all-new episodes Sundays,</i>
<i>and check out our other</i>
<i>Fox programs--</i>

00:09.376 --> 00:12.377
Bob's Burgers, The Simpsons
<i> and</i>  Bless the Harts.

00:12.412 --> 00:13.712
Oh, jeez, I'm so excited.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.748
ANNOUNCER: <i> Only on Fox.</i>

00:17.018 --> 00:20.719
¶<i> It seems today</i>
<i> that all you see</i> ¶

00:20.754 --> 00:24.322
¶<i> Is violence in movies</i>
<i> and sex on TV</i> ¶

00:24.357 --> 00:27.893
¶<i> But where are those</i>
<i> good old-fashioned values</i> ¶

00:27.928 --> 00:30.896
¶<i> On which we used to rely?</i> ¶

00:30.931 --> 00:34.399

00:49.616 --> 00:51.617
(indistinct chatter)

00:53.620 --> 00:55.087
So what's the big emergency?

00:55.122 --> 00:57.055
Why did everyone
have to come in on a Monday?

00:57.090 --> 00:59.758
I'm afraid we have
troubling news.

00:59.793 --> 01:02.861
Due to budget cuts, we'll
be laying off one employee.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.130
(indistinct murmuring)

01:05.165 --> 01:07.532
The Internet pretty much
only lets us fire white males,

01:07.567 --> 01:10.969
so if you're not
a white male, you're safe.

01:11.004 --> 01:12.871
-So, is Derek Jeter safe?
-Safe!

01:12.906 --> 01:14.539
-What?
-He's half black.

01:14.574 --> 01:15.907
-What?
What do you need, glasses?
-No, I don't need glasses.

01:15.942 --> 01:17.108
-He's white by a mile. He tucks
-You're the one
who needs glasses.

01:17.143 --> 01:18.943
-his T-shirts into his pants.
-A lot of people do that.

01:18.979 --> 01:20.812
-And what happened to this kind
of coach-umpire confrontation?
-It's a body temperature issue.

01:20.847 --> 01:22.714
-I know, I miss it, too.
-It used to happen a lot
in the '70s

01:22.749 --> 01:24.783
-but doesn't seem to happen that
much anymore. It's a connection
-Replay has really taken a lot

01:24.818 --> 01:27.285
-to a bygone era when men
settled their differences
-of intimacy out of the game.

01:27.320 --> 01:28.954
-face-to-face,
-I agree. That's what
we're doing now.

01:28.989 --> 01:31.056
-thrusting their chests
into one another.
-I miss having a guy yell

01:31.091 --> 01:32.724
-in my mouth.
-And while we're
talking about stuff,

01:32.759 --> 01:34.826
-I've never cleaned
my ice trays.
-Oh, you have to do that.

01:34.861 --> 01:36.761
-Why do I have to?
-You're poisoning your family.

01:36.796 --> 01:39.164
-It's just water and water.
What's the big deal?
-Carrying an ice tray

01:39.199 --> 01:41.166
from the freezer to the sink
is like ringing

01:41.201 --> 01:42.501
the damn dinner bell
for arm hairs.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.269
Come to think of it,
I do remember seeing a few

01:44.304 --> 01:46.438
-short hairs in my ice cubes
-Of course they're
getting in there.

01:46.473 --> 01:49.241
-that I'm hoping
were from my arm.
-Clean your trays.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.943
Oh, cool off, Griffin.
It is no big deal.

01:51.978 --> 01:53.512
It's just that
someone's getting fired

01:53.547 --> 01:56.248
-in front of everybody tomorrow.
-Well, that sounds fine.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.517
I guess I'll just see you--
What?!

01:58.552 --> 02:00.085
Old joke. You're out.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.754
-Old joke?
I put my own twist on it.
-There was no twist.

02:02.789 --> 02:05.357
-Oh, you're crazy. It was
a tip of the hat to my son.
-I'm crazy? You're lazy.

02:05.392 --> 02:07.792
-If anything, it's a gift
to our long-time viewers.
-Oh, what a gift.

02:07.827 --> 02:09.761
Merry Christmas.
Here's a warmed-over turd

02:09.796 --> 02:11.830
from ten years ago.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.535
Okay, I can do this.

02:16.570 --> 02:17.869
No need to be nervous.

02:17.904 --> 02:19.704
Just show 'em
that I'm good at my job.

02:19.739 --> 02:21.373
That's it. Easy peasy.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.375
(chuckles):
Hey there, PG.

02:23.410 --> 02:24.776
Been a minute.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.179
Hey, Ernie. I mean, I mean
Cookie Monst-- I mean Bert.

02:27.214 --> 02:28.213
Bert. Sorry.

02:28.248 --> 02:29.714
Oh, it's okay, Peter.

02:29.749 --> 02:31.216
Just do what
you would normally do.

02:31.251 --> 02:32.851
Pretend I'm not here.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.553
Oh, pretend you're not here?
All right.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.621
God, that Bert is an idiot.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.190
What a pud.

02:38.225 --> 02:39.691
But I wouldn't mind
getting to know that Sheila

02:39.726 --> 02:40.859
a little better.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.460
She's got a great dumper.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.963
And by dumper,
I mean fecal thoroughfare.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.798
-(phone ringing)
-Should I...?

02:46.833 --> 02:48.133
Yeah, answer it.

02:48.168 --> 02:51.169
Could be important
for the company.

02:51.204 --> 02:53.505
(exhales)

02:53.540 --> 02:54.973
Goodbye?

02:55.008 --> 02:56.975
Ah, shoot.
Opposite of that, yeah?

02:57.010 --> 02:58.677
Let's roll
to the break room, Peter.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.679
We're ready to announce
who's getting fired.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.981
Oh, sure, if Sheila and her
wastemaker are gonna be there.

03:03.016 --> 03:06.084
Please stop talking about
my wife's anal processes.

03:13.693 --> 03:17.395
Opie, will you accept
this stein?

03:17.430 --> 03:20.265
(babbling)

03:23.937 --> 03:26.238
Bachelor Nick? Why are you here?

03:26.273 --> 03:28.406
They make me come
to all these things.

03:28.441 --> 03:29.908
Cool. How's Vanessa?

03:29.943 --> 03:31.943
-We broke up.
-Aw.

03:31.978 --> 03:34.779
I would murder my family
for one hour with Corinne.

03:34.814 --> 03:36.782
Eh, she was a little young.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.118
You know how stupid you sound?

03:40.153 --> 03:43.955
Peter, take a step forward.

03:43.990 --> 03:46.391
I-I'm sorry.
I-I keep messing up.

03:46.426 --> 03:48.760
You're seeing me at my worst.
I'm very nervous.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.233
(heart beating)

03:56.436 --> 03:58.403
My life is flashing
before my eyes.

03:58.438 --> 04:02.140
And for some reason, it's all
just the sort of gay moments.

04:02.175 --> 04:03.575
¶ ¶

04:17.090 --> 04:18.723
Excuse me,
is someone sitting here?

04:18.758 --> 04:20.892
Yes. My lover, Tom.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.327
(gasps)

04:22.362 --> 04:25.563
Oh, Peter!
I'm so happy you're okay.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.565
Whoa, you're alive?

04:27.600 --> 04:30.068
What happened?
Did I have a heart attack?

04:30.103 --> 04:31.670
No, you had a panic attack.

04:31.705 --> 04:34.406
Or, in medical terms,
"a heart attack for wussies."

04:34.441 --> 04:35.740
Hey, we have a bet going.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.742
Do you remember if you put
your wrist to your forehead

04:37.777 --> 04:39.577
like a nancy-boy
when you fainted?

04:39.612 --> 04:41.446
I choose not to answer.

04:41.481 --> 04:43.982
Peter, you need to get
your stress under control.

04:44.017 --> 04:46.084
I'm texting you a link
to a collection of songs

04:46.119 --> 04:47.485
called yacht rock.

04:47.520 --> 04:48.753
Any time I'm feeling stressed,

04:48.788 --> 04:51.122
I play this music,
and it really mellows me out.

04:51.157 --> 04:53.625
-I think it'll work for you.
-Well, what is that?
Is that like...

04:53.660 --> 04:56.027
(angry): ¶<i> Da, da, da,</i>
<i> da, da, da, da, da.</i> ¶

04:56.062 --> 04:57.329
No, no, it's more like...

04:57.364 --> 04:58.663
(mellow):
¶<i> La, da, da, da, da</i> ¶

04:58.698 --> 04:59.964
¶<i> Da, da, da, da, da.</i> ¶

04:59.999 --> 05:02.701
Oh, good. It's...
¶<i> La, da, da, da, da</i> ¶

05:02.736 --> 05:04.536
¶<i> Da, da, da, da.</i> ¶
'Cause I don't like that.

05:04.571 --> 05:06.471
(angry):
¶<i> Da, da, da, ba, ba, ba.</i> ¶

05:06.506 --> 05:08.807
No, I assure you, it's...
¶<i> La, da, da, da</i> ¶

05:08.842 --> 05:10.442
¶<i> Da, da, da, da, da, da, da.</i> ¶

05:10.477 --> 05:11.843
Now, if you'll excuse me,

05:11.878 --> 05:14.980
I have more music
to prescribe to sick patients.

05:18.518 --> 05:20.952
-So, Peter, you feeling better?
-Yeah, I guess.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.388
The doctor just said
I'm too stressed out.

05:23.423 --> 05:25.790
Did the doctor give you anything
to help, you know,

05:25.825 --> 05:27.359
mellow you out?

05:27.394 --> 05:29.661
<i> ¿Los drogas?</i>

05:29.696 --> 05:32.864
No, he just gave me this link
for something called yacht rock.

05:32.899 --> 05:34.866
("Summer Breeze"
by Seals and Crofts playing)

05:34.901 --> 05:36.801
This one's called
"Summer Breeze,"

05:36.836 --> 05:39.971
and it makes me feel fine.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.073
This music-- I...

05:42.108 --> 05:44.843
I feel like I'm dirty dancing
with a sunset.

05:44.878 --> 05:48.146
¶ ¶

05:48.181 --> 05:50.315
Uh, guys,
there's a yacht rock cruise

05:50.350 --> 05:53.184
that leaves
from the Quahog Marina tomorrow.

05:53.219 --> 05:55.687
And I'm not even kidding.

05:55.722 --> 05:58.323
You know what, guys? We haven't
gone anywhere in a long time.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.824
So, let's do it.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.393
Cleveland, buy those tickets,

06:01.428 --> 06:03.661
'cause the guys are going
on a yacht rock cruise.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.163
-Yeah!
-Awesome!

06:05.198 --> 06:06.664
Peter? Is that you?

06:06.699 --> 06:09.501
-Do I know you?
-I-It's me. Lyle?

06:09.536 --> 06:11.202
From the other side
of the aquarium?

06:11.237 --> 06:13.037
I-I...
I don't-- I don't know you.

06:13.072 --> 06:15.373
I-I don't-- I don't know
what you're talking about.

06:15.408 --> 06:17.675
<i> But I did know</i>
<i> what he was talking about.</i>

06:17.710 --> 06:19.844
<i> I spent the next</i>
<i> two and a half years</i>

06:19.879 --> 06:21.679
<i> cruising various aquariums.</i>

06:21.714 --> 06:23.948
<i> I never did find Lyle.</i>

06:23.983 --> 06:27.219
<i> Also, I didn't quite clear</i>
<i> the table.</i>

06:35.962 --> 06:38.963
(indistinct chatter)

06:38.998 --> 06:41.866
I got to say, Peter, I had
reservations about this cruise,

06:41.901 --> 06:43.701
but you do seem more relaxed.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.236
Hey, good thing
I had reservations

06:45.271 --> 06:46.938
<i> on</i> this cruise, huh?

06:46.973 --> 06:49.040
(chuckles)
I don't mind dad jokes.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.742
Everyone's included.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.646
Looks like mine
won't be the only tail

06:54.681 --> 06:56.414
I'll be chasing this week.

06:56.449 --> 06:59.784
-(grunts) Hey. What the...
-All dogs have to be crated
below deck.

06:59.819 --> 07:01.953
(dogs barking)

07:01.988 --> 07:03.488
Stewie, help!

07:03.523 --> 07:05.223
I knew this was
a possibility, so I put

07:05.258 --> 07:09.094
a 1982 Mattel Electronic
Baseball game in your bag.

07:10.663 --> 07:12.130
Okay, that's something.

07:12.165 --> 07:14.132
The battery might be
a little old, though.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.168
(electronic fanfare fades)

07:17.537 --> 07:19.538
(horn blows)

07:23.376 --> 07:24.843
Peter, you brought your family?

07:24.878 --> 07:27.145
This was supposed
to be a guys' trip.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.913
-Please don't tell Donna.
-Please don't tell Bonnie.
She hasn't been

07:28.948 --> 07:30.682
-on a vacation in seven years.
-She'll kill me if she knew
wives were allowed.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.083
-Please, Lois, please.
-Please, Lois.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.485
-Promise me. Here, look,
-Promise me first.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.019
-I'm putting money
-Here's my gun. Do you want it?

07:35.054 --> 07:36.955
-in your purse.
-I-I'm sorry,
I couldn't hear you.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.090
I'm sending a selfie
to Bonnie and Donna.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.925
Cruise, bitches.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.261
-Don't hit send,
please don't hit send.
-Please don't hit send.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.330
And... send.

07:45.365 --> 07:46.798
(phone chimes)

07:46.833 --> 07:49.934
You son of a bitch.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.936
-I told you.
-What did he do now?

07:51.971 --> 07:53.605
He don't listen to you.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.608
He don't listen
to you.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.309
(phone vibrates)

07:58.344 --> 07:59.644
What is it, Bonnie?

07:59.679 --> 08:02.280
Nothing, Father Monaghan.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.616
-Well, this sucks now.
-Our whole trip's ruined,

08:04.651 --> 08:06.117
thanks to you, Peter.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.219
Thank God
Bonnie's got Father Monaghan

08:08.254 --> 08:10.288
for spiritual counsel.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.689
Well, it's not my fault
you guys are too stupid

08:11.724 --> 08:13.157
to understand what the plan was.

08:13.192 --> 08:15.994
-The plan was clear.
You're the stupid one.
-What?

08:16.029 --> 08:19.197
(overlapping arguing)

08:19.232 --> 08:22.700
¶<i> Sailing takes me away...</i> ¶

08:22.735 --> 08:25.336
-What were we fighting about?
-I don't know.

08:25.371 --> 08:28.306
My cares have all
suddenly melted away.

08:28.341 --> 08:31.409
Are my toes tapping?
I feel like my toes are tapping.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.678
Nah, there's a seagull
pecking at your foot.

08:33.713 --> 08:35.013
(squawking)

08:35.048 --> 08:36.548
Whenever I wear my Tevas,

08:36.583 --> 08:39.284
my toes are up for grabs.

08:41.087 --> 08:43.054
Hey, Cleveland, this is us.

08:43.089 --> 08:44.656
You guys got to stop by later.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.392
Snuck on a little
of this action.

08:47.427 --> 08:49.227
What? You guys
are sharing a room?

08:49.262 --> 08:50.395
You're adults.

08:50.430 --> 08:52.430
I'm not paying full price
for a room.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.566
Have some self-respect.
You're 40.

08:54.601 --> 08:56.568
(scoffs) It's not like
we're gonna be in there much.

08:56.603 --> 08:58.436
Too busy scoping trim.

08:58.471 --> 09:01.339
I may bail to the room
to catch a nap.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.508
Right behind you, roomie.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.878
After we wake,
we gonna fire up that Keurig.

09:06.913 --> 09:10.549
Oh, yeah, that's why I brought
along a couple of these babies.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.285
Wait, there's only one bed.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.387
I know. We're going head to toe.

09:16.422 --> 09:18.790
Say hello to your pillow.

09:18.825 --> 09:21.459
Hi there, do you know if singer
and songwriter Bob Welch

09:21.494 --> 09:22.794
is on board yet?

09:22.829 --> 09:25.930
He's not,
because he died in 2012.

09:25.965 --> 09:27.865
(gasps)

09:27.900 --> 09:30.368
Can you give me a moment?

09:30.403 --> 09:33.204
¶<i> Sentimental gentle wind</i> ¶

09:33.239 --> 09:36.374
¶<i> Blowing through</i>

09:36.409 --> 09:39.877
I can't believe Bob Welch
is really gone.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.813
¶<i> Gentle one...</i> ¶

09:41.848 --> 09:45.883
Hey... we just heard
about Bob Welch.

09:45.918 --> 09:47.885
¶<i> Blowing through</i>
<i> my life again...</i> ¶

09:47.920 --> 09:49.554
Yeah.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.823
Who the (bleep) is Bob Welch?

09:52.859 --> 09:54.326
(horn blows)

09:55.862 --> 09:57.862
(indistinct chatter)

10:01.034 --> 10:03.301
Okay, for the first game,
I choose Alan Parsons

10:03.336 --> 10:05.637
as my teammate,
but not The Project.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.271
I want nothing to do with them.

10:07.306 --> 10:09.007
We'll play Joe and Loggins.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.275
-Thanks for picking me, Peter.
-No problem.

10:11.310 --> 10:13.611
"Crosby, Stills, Nash"
to see who goes first?

10:13.646 --> 10:15.813
BOTH:
Crosby, Stills, Nash, shoot.

10:15.848 --> 10:18.916
-Nash. I win.
-No, Crosby eats Nash.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.853
-Stills snorts Crosby.
-What does Nash do?

10:21.888 --> 10:23.855
Nash smokes Stills.

10:23.890 --> 10:26.124
So, Kenny, "Footloose."

10:26.159 --> 10:28.926
Not really a song for everyone.

10:28.961 --> 10:32.263
Well, maybe you'd prefer my song
in<i> Caddyshack,</i> "I'm Alright."

10:32.298 --> 10:35.767
Wh-What, do you think I'm stupid
because I'm in a chair?

10:35.802 --> 10:37.435
I'll pull the tape, guy.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.305
The gopher sang that song.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.378
This is so exciting.
What do you want to do tonight?

10:47.413 --> 10:49.814
What if we just go see a movie?

10:49.849 --> 10:52.283
We can see a movie at home.
We need to go out.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.651
Shake things up.

10:53.686 --> 10:56.054
We're here to experience
new things, be other people.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.289
Mm-hmm.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.325
How much wine
have you had tonight?

11:01.828 --> 11:03.795
Maybe we could hang out
with that nice couple

11:03.830 --> 11:06.030
-we met the other day.
-The Federmans?

11:06.065 --> 11:08.299
Why do you always want
to hang out with other people

11:08.334 --> 11:09.967
when we're on vacation?

11:10.002 --> 11:11.703
It's just nice
to meet new people.

11:11.738 --> 11:15.406
Right, because I'm so interested
in the medical supply business.

11:15.441 --> 11:17.475
-Why do you always do that?
-Do what?

11:17.510 --> 11:19.477
Diminish people.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.812
Oh, that's why.

11:20.847 --> 11:24.015
Well, I feel like this has
become a referendum on me,

11:24.050 --> 11:26.918
and I don't appreciate it.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.221
Did you pack
my dandruff shampoo?

11:30.256 --> 11:31.689
-No.
-(sighs)

11:31.724 --> 11:34.425
Then I guess
this black shirt is out.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.828
You just want to hang out
with Doug Federman.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.397
What? That's...
that's the wine talking.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.599
What does Doug Federman have
that I don't?

11:41.634 --> 11:43.267
-A job.
-(grunts)

11:43.302 --> 11:46.437
I'm going to watch the magic
show in the Cognac Club.

11:46.472 --> 11:48.206
Why, because there's
a two-drink minimum?

11:48.241 --> 11:51.008
Oh, you shut up!

11:51.043 --> 11:52.343
-(applause)
-Thank you.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.779
For my next trick,
I'll need a volunteer.

11:54.814 --> 11:57.181
-How about you, sir?
-No, I don't want to!

11:57.216 --> 11:59.617
I don't want to do it.

12:02.588 --> 12:05.389
BOTH:
Bell, Biv, DeVoe, shoot.

12:05.424 --> 12:07.425
-(laughs) Gotcha.
-What do you mean?

12:07.460 --> 12:09.694
I win. Bell bivs DeVoe.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.230
Dude, you can't "biv" someone.
Biv's a guy.

12:12.265 --> 12:15.633
Everybody on this cruise
is boring.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.237
CHAD:
I can show you where there's

12:19.272 --> 12:21.673
a whole pile of those.

12:22.742 --> 12:23.975
Cigarette butts?

12:24.010 --> 12:26.477
Yeah. The wind blows them all
to this one spot.

12:26.512 --> 12:28.379
It's right by where
the seagulls crap.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.781
It's my job to clean it up.

12:29.816 --> 12:31.549
That's how I know about it.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.051
You must know a lot about crap.

12:34.086 --> 12:35.720
You're not from here, are you?

12:35.755 --> 12:38.122
From the cruise?
No. I'm from a town.

12:38.157 --> 12:40.057
You want to mess around
on some damp towels

12:40.092 --> 12:41.459
next to where the seagulls crap?

12:41.494 --> 12:42.894
It wasn't seagulls.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.729
I got locked out
of my room earlier.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.063
Oh.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.466
-Why is your poop white?
-I don't know.

12:48.501 --> 12:51.969
I've been dealing with
fecal albinism my whole life.

heard about Bob Welch.

and I didn't like
what they had at dinner.

your fecal albinism.

where the hull's
only an inch thick.

an apple real quick.

17:56.275 --> 17:59.043
Granny Smith? What,
do you got a oven in your mouth?

-Pie apple. It's a pie apple.

-Science apple.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.798
Fuji for eating,
crab for huckin'.

Gosh, Cleveland, I had no idea
you knew so much about apples.

18:25.437 --> 18:28.472

20:46.512 --> 20:48.712
She writes, "Dear Casey,

20:48.747 --> 20:51.882
"is Christopher Cross
as nice as he seems?

20:51.917 --> 20:53.617
"Also, aren't you dead?

20:53.652 --> 20:55.653
"And why did your large wife

20:55.688 --> 20:57.888
"hide your body
from your children?"

20:57.923 --> 21:01.558
Well, the answer to your first
question is a resounding yes.

21:01.593 --> 21:04.061
Christopher Cross
is a perfect gentleman.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.496
And as for the second question,

21:05.531 --> 21:06.930
you're correct, Melanie.

21:06.965 --> 21:08.465
I'm extremely dead,

21:08.500 --> 21:11.101
and I do wish my children
could have closure.

21:11.136 --> 21:13.504
Honey,
if you're listening, please,

21:13.539 --> 21:16.173
just put my body in the ground.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.442
And now back to the countdown.
