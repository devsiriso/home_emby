Tommy realises that the Shelbys need to evolve if they are to survive, but some of the family are reluctant to part with tradition.

As the strike takes hold at the Lanchester factory, Tommy pays a personal visit to Jessie Eden, but he is outmanoeuvred when she reveals something she knows about his past.

Changretta plots to continue the vendetta in the most devastating way possible. As well as identifying an enemy of the Shelby family who could help him, Luca makes direct contact with someone at the heart of the Peaky Blinders organisation.</Overview><ProductionCode></ProductionCode><Rating>8.2</Rating><RatingCount>174</RatingCount><SeasonNumber>4</SeasonNumber><Writer>|Steven Knight|</Writer><absolute_number>21</absolute_number><airsafter_season>0</airsafter_season><airsbefore_episode>0</airsbefore_episode><airsbefore_season>0</airsbefore_season><filename>episodes/270915/6390357.jpg</filename><lastupdated>1647899726</lastupdated><seasonid>718740</seasonid><seriesid>270915</seriesid><thumb_added>2019-11-13 11:07:46</thumb_added><thumb_height>360</thumb_height><thumb_width>640</thumb_width></Episode>
