Remarkably, it is Dr. Cox who is the voice of reason and compassion, until his own fears get in the way.
Meanwhile, Turk and Elliot have their own issues to deal with. Turk is upset because he wasn't chosen to assist on a difficult surgery and Elliot is criticized during rounds by Dr. Kelso for the 100th time.
