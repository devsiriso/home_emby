She is listening to Katie's and Denise's conversation about their sex lives. Katie finds it hard to be sexually active because of how busy she is at Sacred Heart. She then rejects Howie's offer. Denise states that she like guys with some meat on them because they "try harder".

Dr. John Dorian enters the room, apologizes for having to leave, and continues giving a lesson about hospital vernacular. He explains many acronyms such as CTD (circling the drain), T.C.W. (tasty coma wife), "gomer" (get outta my emergency room), turfing and bouncing (send patients to other wards), LGFD (looks good from door) and HFFA (hot from far away). He then ends the lecture and leaves. Sunny finds a strange note which tells her "Meeting in broom closet after lecture. Be there." which none of the other interns received.</Overview><ProductionCode></ProductionCode><Rating>7</Rating><RatingCount>140</RatingCount><SeasonNumber>0</SeasonNumber><Writer>|Melody Derloshon|</Writer><absolute_number>0</absolute_number><airsafter_season>0</airsafter_season><airsbefore_episode>3</airsbefore_episode><airsbefore_season>8</airsbefore_season><filename>episodes/76156/432105.jpg</filename><lastupdated>1573649182</lastupdated><seasonid>23614</seasonid><seriesid>76156</seriesid><thumb_added>2019-11-13 12:46:22</thumb_added><thumb_height>360</thumb_height><thumb_width>640</thumb_width></Episode>
