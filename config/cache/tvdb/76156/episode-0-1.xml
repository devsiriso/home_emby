She double majored in Pre-Med and Film at college, so she promises they won't be boring. Using freeze frames, she introduces herself and explains her nickname, Katie as possibly two-faced, Howie as snarky, Ed as always late, and Denise as her new Besty, but Denise comes off as kind of a bully.

In orientation, Ted tells the interns that lawsuits are bad and that they should never tell a patient if they make a mistake. Dr. Cox enters the orientation and tells the interns that it will not be a fun year for anybody, and when Sunny tells her camera she is still going to enjoy it, he confiscates her camera.

Later, Sunny tells the camera that a Janitor sold her her camera back, and pays The Worthless Peons to perform a theme song for her video diary.</Overview><ProductionCode></ProductionCode><Rating>6.7</Rating><RatingCount>168</RatingCount><SeasonNumber>0</SeasonNumber><Writer>|Devin Mahoney|</Writer><absolute_number>0</absolute_number><airsafter_season>0</airsafter_season><airsbefore_episode>1</airsbefore_episode><airsbefore_season>8</airsbefore_season><filename>episodes/76156/432104.jpg</filename><lastupdated>1573649182</lastupdated><seasonid>23614</seasonid><seriesid>76156</seriesid><thumb_added>2019-11-13 12:46:22</thumb_added><thumb_height>480</thumb_height><thumb_width>640</thumb_width></Episode>
