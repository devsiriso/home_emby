He yells at her when she doesn't want to buy him a coffee because he is already drinking one, and he eventually begins telling her advice anyway. He tells her that she must always be on time, always have a weak friend to blame her problems on, and always keep secrets about rendezvous in the on-call room.

As Sunny states that she has to give the camcorder to her sister so she can record her ugly baby, she shows clips of Ed, Denise, Katie, and Howie remembering the advice they learned around the hospital.</Overview><ProductionCode></ProductionCode><Rating>7</Rating><RatingCount>28</RatingCount><SeasonNumber>0</SeasonNumber><Writer></Writer><absolute_number>0</absolute_number><airsafter_season>0</airsafter_season><airsbefore_episode>15</airsbefore_episode><airsbefore_season>8</airsbefore_season><filename>episodes/76156/621251.jpg</filename><lastupdated>1573649182</lastupdated><seasonid>23614</seasonid><seriesid>76156</seriesid><thumb_added>2019-11-13 12:46:22</thumb_added><thumb_height>360</thumb_height><thumb_width>640</thumb_width></Episode>
