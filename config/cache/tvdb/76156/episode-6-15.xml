One by one, the staff say their goodbyes, except Carla, who stoutly refuses to accept what's happening. She consequently finds herself "haunted" by Laverne. Meanwhile, Jordan gives birth, but Dr. Cox doesn't want to tell anyone because he doesn't want his daughter's birthday to always be associated with Laverne's death.</Overview><ProductionCode>614</ProductionCode><Rating>7.7</Rating><RatingCount>1089</RatingCount><SeasonNumber>6</SeasonNumber><Writer>|Dave Tennant|</Writer><absolute_number>131</absolute_number><airsafter_season>0</airsafter_season><airsbefore_episode>0</airsbefore_episode><airsbefore_season>0</airsbefore_season><filename>episodes/76156/323045.jpg</filename><lastupdated>1573649182</lastupdated><seasonid>16440</seasonid><seriesid>76156</seriesid><thumb_added>2019-11-13 12:46:22</thumb_added><thumb_height>480</thumb_height><thumb_width>640</thumb_width></Episode>
