In the outtakes, Janitor argues with Ted who can't seem to remember any of his lines. Ted also complains about his sweater being very itchy, and tries to take it off, but the Janitor won't let him. The Janitor also quizzes Ted as to what "jump the shark" means, and he can't answer. Ted also explains that he has never had to memorize a closing statement for a court case before. In the end, Ted can't stand his sweater anymore and ends up pulling it over his face, running into a wall, and falling to the ground.

At the same time, Todd hides behind the couch and the counter holding the "child" in the sitcom.</Overview><ProductionCode></ProductionCode><Rating>0</Rating><RatingCount>0</RatingCount><SeasonNumber>0</SeasonNumber><Writer>|Ryan Kemp|</Writer><absolute_number>0</absolute_number><airsafter_season>0</airsafter_season><airsbefore_episode>12</airsbefore_episode><airsbefore_season>8</airsbefore_season><filename>episodes/76156/448961.jpg</filename><lastupdated>1573649182</lastupdated><seasonid>23614</seasonid><seriesid>76156</seriesid><thumb_added>2019-11-13 12:46:22</thumb_added><thumb_height>360</thumb_height><thumb_width>640</thumb_width></Episode>
