Monique and Genevieve disagree over what the ancestors want from them, and Genevieve reveals her plan to build the witches power. When Elijah focuses his attention on restoring their home to its former glory, Klaus accuses him of doing it only to impress Hayley. Next, Klaus sets a new plan in motion by finding Cary, a werewolf from his own line, and sending him off to find a missing piece of family history. Marcel lets Thierry in on his new plan to rebuild his power, but Diego has his own ideas about the future. At the Feast of the Blessings, Monique and Genevieve try to use the ceremony to teach Davina a lesson, but Klaus intervenes and gives Davina a surprisingly important gift. While Hayley struggles to decide where her loyalties should lie, the ceremony explodes into violence.</Overview><ProductionCode>2J7818</ProductionCode><Rating>7.4</Rating><RatingCount>492</RatingCount><SeasonNumber>1</SeasonNumber><Writer>|Marguerite MacIntyre|Michael Russo|</Writer><absolute_number>18</absolute_number><airsafter_season>0</airsafter_season><airsbefore_episode>0</airsbefore_episode><airsbefore_season>0</airsbefore_season><filename>episodes/266883/4824483.jpg</filename><lastupdated>1653692768</lastupdated><seasonid>516064</seasonid><seriesid>266883</seriesid><thumb_added>2019-11-13 12:38:11</thumb_added><thumb_height>360</thumb_height><thumb_width>640</thumb_width></Episode>
