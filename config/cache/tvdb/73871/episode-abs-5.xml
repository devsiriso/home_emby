They're only there to clean up, polish the balls or water the fields. They never get any respect. Later, Bender must deliver a package to a planet inhabited by murderous robots that kill humans on sight. He discovers a robotopia - a land where the robot is king! However, when Leela and Fry are captured, Bender must choose between protecting his celebrity status or saving his friends.</Overview><ProductionCode>1ACV05</ProductionCode><Rating>7.4</Rating><RatingCount>2230</RatingCount><SeasonNumber>1</SeasonNumber><Writer>|Evan Gore|Heather Lombard|</Writer><absolute_number>5</absolute_number><airsafter_season>0</airsafter_season><airsbefore_episode>0</airsbefore_episode><airsbefore_season>0</airsbefore_season><filename>series/73871/episodes/6039781e65672.jpg</filename><lastupdated>1620920736</lastupdated><seasonid>6588</seasonid><seriesid>73871</seriesid><thumb_added>2021-02-26 22:37:17</thumb_added><thumb_height>480</thumb_height><thumb_width>640</thumb_width></Episode>
