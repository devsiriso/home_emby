They end up going through the Bermuda Tetrahedron and find a ton of lost spaceships - including the original Planet Express! They look around the ship and a 4D whale comes by and eats the old ship and the statue. Leela makes it her mission to kill the whale and get revenge, which makes them late for the memorial. Eventually, the whale eats the Planet Express ship and the whole team. The only person who escapes is Zoidberg, who returns to Earth in an escape pod. While inside the whale, Leela meets the original captain of the ship, Lando Tucker, who is now attached to the whale's stomach. Leela ends up being able to control the whale and steers him back to Earth to attend the memorial. Leela coaxes the whale to spit everything out, including the statue and the original crew and kills the whale.</Overview><ProductionCode>6ACV15</ProductionCode><Rating>7.4</Rating><RatingCount>2751</RatingCount><SeasonNumber>6</SeasonNumber><Writer>|Dan Vebber|</Writer><absolute_number>92</absolute_number><airsafter_season>0</airsafter_season><airsbefore_episode>0</airsbefore_episode><airsbefore_season>0</airsbefore_season><filename>series/73871/episodes/5e7974cae5872.jpg</filename><lastupdated>1630944488</lastupdated><seasonid>103941</seasonid><seriesid>73871</seriesid><thumb_added>2020-03-24 02:47:38</thumb_added><thumb_height>360</thumb_height><thumb_width>640</thumb_width></Episode>
